# StrayApp

Welcome to Stray! This app can run independantally of other software however you must have internet access for the app to function properly. The reason for this is that the app relies on Firebase’s “Firestore” database in order to handle entries and queries.

This app was built in android studio so likely the smoothest workflow possible post download comes from android studio.

People who worked on this app include Zane Foote (ZaneF8397), Aidan Collins (ac217), and Nick Brogan (npbrogan).
